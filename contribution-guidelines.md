# Contribution Guidelines

## Discuss big changes as Issues first

Significant improvements should be documented as GitHub issues before anybody starts to code. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give feedback on the design, and maybe point out if related work is under way.

Please take a moment to check whether an issue already exists. If it does, it never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

## Pull Requests always welcome

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as quickly as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

We're also trying very hard to keep IPFS focused. This means that we might decide against incorporating a new feature. However, there might be a Signway to implement that feature on top of (or below) IPFS.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! If there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you received feedback on what to improve.

## Conventions

Each repository will have its own code and test conventions. Please make sure to review those before jumping in. Some general conventions are listed below.

If you are contributing to a repository written in Go, please look at the [Go Contribution Guidelines](go-contribution-guidelines.md).

### Git

We use a simple git branching model:

- `master` must always work
- create feature-branches to merge into `master`
- all commits must pass testing so that git bisect is easy to run

Just stay current with master (rebase).

### Code

Write clean code. Universally formatted code promotes ease of writing, reading, and maintenance.

### Tests

Submit tests with your changes. Take a look at existing tests for inspiration. Run the full test suite on your branch before submitting a pull request.

For commandline tool changes, please write appropriate sharness tests.

### Documentation

Update documentation when creating or modifying features. Test your documentation changes for clarity, concision, and correctness, as well as a clean documentation build.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests descriptions should be as clear as possible. Err on the side of overly specific and include a reference to all related issues. If the pull request is meant to close an issue please use the Github keyword conventions of [closes, fixes, or resolves]( https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/). If the pull request only completes part of an issue use the [connects keywords]( https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#prs-connect-keywords). This helps our tools properly link issues to pull requests. 

### Code Review

We take code quality seriously; we must make sure the code remains correct. We do code review on all changesets. Discuss any comments, then make modifications and push additional commits to your feature branch. Be sure to post a comment after pushing. The new commits will show up in the pull request automatically, but the reviewers will not be notified unless you comment.

We use `LFCR` (Looking For Code Review) as a signal that something needs review. For example:

```
I addressed the comments. The gateway now returns cache headers.
@jbenet LFCR
```

### Rebasing

Pull requests **must be cleanly rebased ontop of master** without multiple branches mixed into the PR. If master advances while your PR is in review, please keep rebasing it. It makes all our work much less error-prone.

Before the pull request is merged, make sure that you squash your commits into logical units of work using `git rebase -i` and `git push -f`. After _every commit_ the test suite must be passing. This is so we can revert pieces, and so we can quickly bisect problems. Include documentation changes and tests in the same commit so that a revert would remove all traces of the feature or fix.

### Merge Approval

We use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the code review to indicate acceptance. A change **requires** LGTMs from the maintainers of each component affected. If you know who it may be, ping them. If not, ping `@jbenet`. (We will be adding a listing here.)
