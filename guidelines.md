# Guidelines
## Writing

When writing for ipfs, be it commit messages or posting issues, here's a collection of things to take note of.

### Ungendering

#### Motivation

To avoid gendering in community interaction has multiple benefits. Avoiding the alienating feeling of documentation implicitly misgendering you, "the user and his computer". This is true of roughly half the population. Using plural forms is a good hack on the english language to get around this problem. This also includes extraterrestial beings and future lifeforms.

#### Proposal

Avoid gendering in writing, do not assume that the user/reader is of a certain gender. 

Do's:
```
users install ipfs on their computers
users can choose what to broadcast in the DHT
```

Don'ts:
```
the user installs ipfs on his computer
user A can choose if the hash of her newly added file is broadcasted
```

Established canon like Alice and Bob can still be used in the gendered way.
